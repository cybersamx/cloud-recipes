# Terraform If-Else

Terraform supports the if-else statement through the `count` construct, which means that conditionals can only be set for resources.

We can insert an `if` expression within the nested block of `for` and `for_each` expression. See recipes [for](../loop/for) and [for_each](../loop/for-each) for details.
